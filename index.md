## The  Laboratory  for  Visual,  Embodied  and  Immersive  Data  Analysis  (VEiDA)

The  Laboratory  for  Visual,  Embodied  and  Immersive  Data  Analysis  (VEiDA),  represents  a  state-of-the-artresearch facility that supports the development of interactive and immersive frameworks for Exploratory DataAnalysis (EDA). Frameworks that attempt to deal with traditional barriers to comprehension by investigatingnovel tools and strategies that leverage human visual reasoning together with tactile and motor perception,in order to promote enhanced cognition, comprehension and knowledge discovery.

Unique  within  Canada,  VEiDA  is  a  highly  reconfigurable  lab  will  facilitate  that  will  enable  the  rapiddevelopment  of  innovative  visuo-tangible  frameworks  for  EDA,  utilized  in  applications  deployed  across  arange sectors from cultural heritage, to 3D multimedia, manufacturing, biology, health and medicine. Withdata  and  analytics  projected  to  be  a  major  driver  of  revenue  growth  in  coming  years,  and  the  massivegrowth in immersive technologies. VEiDA will strengthen Canada's leadership in existing and emerging digitaleconomies.
